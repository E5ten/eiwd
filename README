eiwd - iwd without dbus
-----------

STATUS (GUTTED AND SOMEWHAT HACKY)

* Daemon works without DBUS.
* Simple client implemented (iwc).
* Simple tool added (iwd_passphrase).

GOALS

* Implement our own full client in C using a different IPC.
* Bring 'wired/' back into tree and get it to function without DBUS.
