Wireless daemon for Linux
*************************

Copyright (C) 2013-2014  Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.


Compilation and installation
============================

In order to compile the source code you need following software packages:
	- GCC compiler
	- GNU C library
	- Embedded Linux library

To configure run:
	./configure --prefix=/usr

Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.

To compile and install run:
	make && make install


Embedded Linux library
======================

In order to compile the daemon and control utility the development version
of Embedded Linux library is required to be present. The development
repositories can be found here:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git

The build systems requires that the Embedded Linux library source code
is available on the same top level directory as the Wireless daemon
source code:

	.
	|--- ell
	|    |--- ell
	|    `--- unit
	`--- iwd
	     |--- src
	     `--- client

It is not required to build or install Embedded Linux library. The build
will happen when building the Wireless daemon and it will then be linked
internally.


Kernel dependencies
===================

In order to use this daemon and control utility the kdbus kernel module
is required. The development repositories can be found here:

	https://github.com/gregkh/kdbus
	https://code.google.com/p/d-bus/

The daemon will start its own private bus that is located at the /dev/kdbus
device hierarchy:

	/dev/kdbus
	|--- control
	`--- 0-iwd
	     `--- bus

When started as root, the new private bus will be /dev/kdbus/0-iwd/bus
and it can be verified with the busctl utility from systemd:

	# busctl --address=kernel:path=/dev/kdbus/0-iwd/bus
	NAME       PID  PROCESS     USER      CONNECTION    CONNECTION-NAME
	:1.1     62151  iwd         root      :1.1          iwd
	:1.2     62153  busctl      root      :1.2          sd-busctl

Clients talking to the daemon must specifiy the private bus address.
