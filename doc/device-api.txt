================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.Device [Experimental]
Object path	/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		void Scan()

			Schedule a network scan.

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 new.connman.iwd.Failed

		void Disconnect()

			Disconnect from the network

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 new.connman.iwd.Failed
					 new.connman.iwd.NotConnected

		array(osns) GetOrderedNetworks()

			Return the list of networks found in the most recent
			scan, sorted by their user interface importance
			score as calculated by iwd.  If the device is
			currently connected to a network, that network is
			always first on the list, followed by any known
			networks that have been used at least once before,
			followed by any other known networks and any other
			detected networks as the last group.  Within these
			groups the maximum relative signal-strength is the
			main sorting factor.

			Every record returned contains a 4-tuple of the
			following values.

			object Object

				net.connman.iwd.Network object representing
				the network.

			string Name

				Contains the Name (SSID) of the network

			int16 SignalStrength

				Network's maximum signal strength expressed
				in 100 * dBm.  The value is the range of 0
				(strongest signal) to -10000 (weakest signal)

			string Type

				Contains the type of the network.  Possible
				types are "open", "psk", "8021x" (EAP)

Properties	string Name [readonly]

			Device's interface name

		string Address [readonly]

			Interface's hardware address in the XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
			format

		string State [readonly]

			Reflects the general network connection state.  One of:

			"connected", "disconnected", "connecting", "disconnecting"

		object ConnectedNetwork [readonly, optional]

			net.connman.iwd.Network object representing the
			network the device is currently connected to or to
			which a connection is in progress.

		boolean Powered [readwrite]

			True if the interface is UP.  If false, the device's
			radio is powered down and no other actions can
			be performed on the device.

		boolean Scanning [readonly]

			Reflects whether the device is currently scanning
			for networks.  net.connman.iwd.Network objects are
			updated when this property goes from true to false.
