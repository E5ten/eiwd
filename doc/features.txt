Wireless monitor
================

Netlink monitor interface is created if it does not exist

The iwmon utility automates netlink monitor creation by by using RTNL
to find an existing netlink monitor interface, and in case it does not
exist, create a new one. By default the netlink monitor interface is
named 'nlmon'. Another name can be given with the '--interface'
command line option.

Once iwmon terminates, the netlink monitor interface is removed (in
case iwmon created it).
