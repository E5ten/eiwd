Wireless monitor
================

Netlink monitor interface is created if it does not exist

The iwmon utility automates netlink monitor creation by by using RTNL
to find an existing netlink monitor interface, and in case it does not
exist, create a new one. By default the netlink monitor interface is
named 'nlmon'. Another name can be given with the '--interface'
command line option.

Once iwmon terminates, the netlink monitor interface is removed (in
case iwmon created it).


HWSIM
=====

The radio id from kernel mac80211_hwsim module is parsed properly in
hwsim. The radio id is not returned as HWSIM_ATTR_RADIO_ID but instead
it is returned in error message. If the error code > 0, then that means
the radio id. If the error code < 0, then that indicates a real error.
